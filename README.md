# Cloud 9 Grooming


## Description

This is CBC9's group project, Cloud9 Grooming, a website that offers coupons for a fictional dog grooming business. There are three main pages: the welcome page, where you are greeted with the business information, the customer page, where a customer may register for a free coupon by giving their name and phone number to a database, and the admin page, where the contents of the database are displayed in an orderly manner- but you need to enter a password to access the admin page.  There are no user accounts, just a basic password to log in.
